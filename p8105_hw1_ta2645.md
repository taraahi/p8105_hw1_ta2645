# Problem 1

Below is a code chunk that creates a data frame compromised of a random
sample of size 10 from a standard normal distribution. It includes:

-   a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
-   a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
    greater than 0
-   a character vector of length 10
-   a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r

problem1_df = tibble(
  samp = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = samp > 0,
  vec_char = c("My", "name", "is", "Tara", "and", "I", "am", "learning", "data",                "science"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("true", "maybe", "false", "true", "maybe", "false",                    "true", "maybe", "false", "true"))
)

problem1_df
## # A tibble: 10 × 4
##      samp vec_logical vec_char vec_factor
##     <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>    <fct>     
##  1 -0.108 FALSE       My       true      
##  2  0.998 TRUE        name     maybe     
##  3 -0.145 FALSE       is       false     
##  4  0.963 TRUE        Tara     true      
##  5  1.03  TRUE        and      maybe     
##  6  0.466 TRUE        I        false     
##  7 -0.387 FALSE       am       true      
##  8  0.543 TRUE        learning maybe     
##  9 -0.489 FALSE       data     false     
## 10  0.313 TRUE        science  true
```

Next we will pull the individual variables from the data frame to take
the mean.

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, samp))
mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_logical))
mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_char))
mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_factor))
```

The mean of the sample is 0.3182901. The mean of vec\_logical is 0.6. We
cannot take the mean of the character or factor variables because they
are compromised of characters, not numbers.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, vec_logical))
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, vec_char))
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, vec_factor))
```

The logical and factor variables are converted to numbers (1/0 and
1/2/3, respectively). This is because they have distinct levels that can
be assigned numeric values. The character variables is returned as NA as
the values cannot be categorized, which is also why we couldn’t take the
mean.
